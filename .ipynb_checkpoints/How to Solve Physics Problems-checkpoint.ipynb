      "I love physics. Now that's out of the way it must be said that there are many people out there who DON'T love physics, and may even have good reasons to feel that way. Regardless many of you will have to study physics and learn how to do physics problems if you havent already, and the most common mistakes that come with doing physics study is the way in which students approach problems. Textbooks and websites are replete with worked examples of specific physics problems, but relatively few actually discuss a strategy for approaching entirely novel physics problems. That's what we're trying to explain here. This method won't work for everyone, and some people will develop their own unique techniques, however this will hopefully give you some idea of where to start!"

      "That gives you some idea of the process and i'll illustrate this in a moment with some examples.   \n",
      "However it should be obvious that in order to follow through those steps there are things you will have to memorise. In general people assume that Step 2 and Step 5 are the most important and consequently memorize a great list of formulae and (ocassionaly) units as well. That does help, but a far more efficient way is to instead focus on Step 3: principles and concepts. What you should be aiming for, to test if you _know_ a topic is to check whether your brain is instinctivly associating questions with particular concepts. If, when you're presented with a questions, you don't have any idea which concepts you need to solve it, that tells you that you either don't understand the subject matter or just aren't familiar enough with it yet. Only once you can correctly identify concepts of a problem should you concern yourself with re-gurgitating formula and units.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Why? Once you correctly identify the concept(s) needed for a problem you will already have an idea of the units involved. And from those will come the related formula. Having a central focus (the concept) to hinge the formula on makes it far easier for the brain to retain associations between things and soon you will find yourself remembering formula, units and yes even universal constants without actually ever having to sit down and memorize them. \n",

      "As an example, for me I frequently remember stories about how the concept was discovered and almost _never_ remember the names of the people involved. For example did you know that when AC and DC were first discovered, Nikolai Tesla and Thomas Edison each touted one over the other in a [_War of Currents_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Currents) that ended up with people travelling the country and horrifically electrocuting animals with the other's current in front of crowd of on-lookers. Who won? Neither really, both DC and AC have their uses but specifically AC is good for tranporting electricity long distances but requires high voltages to do so (it significantly lowers the power lost during transmission) and so at first seems much more dangerous. The reality is that _current_ is what kills/harms, not voltage alone and both AC or DC can kill if the opportunity arises. I specifically remember all of that because of this picture ![Topsy](http://cienciaxxi.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/topsy.jpg) of an elephant that was electrocuted in 1903 (turns out it had nothing to do with the war of currents above - but in my memory that's what it is connected to)\n",

Howard's levitating superconductor for rememebering induction, or looking at rainbow diffraction patterns to remember the physics of atomic line spectra are both examples I hinge my knowledge on today and a recent episode of Cosmos has provided me with a way to remember black body radiation through the accidental discovery of infra-red light.\n",
